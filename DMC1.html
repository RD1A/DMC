<h2>Welcome to the world in the Devil May Cry Universe</h2>

<P>About the story
  Dante heads to Mallet Island after a run-in with a woman named Trish, who barges into his shop and requests his assistance in ridding the world of demons for good. She states that Mundus, a demon Sparda had defeated two millenia ago was looking to return and rule the human world. Seeing that Mundus is behind all of this, Dante brings Force Edge, his father's sword, along.

After arriving at Mallet Island and confronting Mundus' generals - Nightmare, Griffin, Nelo Angelo and Phantom, Dante defeats each one, while discovering that one of the generals is in fact Vergil, his twin brother. After the Vergil's final defeat, Dante acquires the other half of the amulet. Combining them together along with his father's Force Edge, he reawakens the Force Edge's true form - Sparda, and treks on into the Demon World. While in a battle with Nightmare, Trish betrays Dante and revives Nightmare for one more go.

Dante, however, manages to defeat Nightmare again, triggering something within Nightmare to cause it to fire wildly before finally being destroyed. In the chaos that ensues, Trish almost gets crushed by a falling pillar but Dante saves her out of the fact that she looks like his mother. This troubles Trish greatly, as she doesn't completely understand.

After the final battle with Nightmare, Dante finally reaches Mundus's lair. During their 'talk', Mundus shows Dante Trish who is hung high up on a wall. During the short moment Dante is distracted, Mundus shoots some spikes at him, locking his movements. He is about to finish him off when Trish jumps in front of Dante and saves his life while giving up her own. In his rage, Dante devil triggers, channeling Sparda's power through himself to gain his father's form and promptly defeats Mundus.

After returning from the battle to Trish's body, he leaves the pendants and the Sparda Sword with her.

Returning to the castle, an injured mutated Mundus confronts Dante again. In the midst of their battle, Trish returns and tells Dante to use her power, channeling her energy through him. Dante does so and seals Mundus again with a classic move from his younger days. After this, Trish and Dante escape the island on a plane as it collapses and become partners.
