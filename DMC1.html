          <h2>Welcome to the world in the Devil May Cry Universe</h2>

          <P CLass="story">About the story
            Dante heads to Mallet Island after a run-in with a woman named Trish, who barges into his shop and requests
            his assistance in ridding the world of demons for good. She states that Mundus, a demon Sparda had defeated
            two millenia ago was looking to return and rule the human world. br Seeing that Mundus is behind all of
            this, Dante brings Force Edge, his father's sword, along. <br>

            After arriving at Mallet Island and confronting Mundus' generals - Nightmare, Griffin, Nelo Angelo and
            Phantom, Dante defeats each one, while discovering that one of the generals is in fact Vergil, his twin
            brother. After the Vergil's final defeat, Dante acquires the other half of the amulet. <br>
            Dante, however, manages to defeat Nightmare again, triggering something within Nightmare to cause it to fire
            wildly before finally being destroyed. In the chaos that ensues, Trish almost gets crushed by a falling
            pillar but Dante saves her out of the fact that she looks like his mother.This troubles Trish greatly, as
            she doesn't completely understand. <br>

            After the final battle with Nightmare, Dante finally reaches Mundus's lair. During their 'talk', Mundus
            shows Dante Trish who is hung high up on a wall. During the short moment Dante is distracted, Mundus shoots
            some spikes at him, locking his movements. He is about to finish him off when Trish jumps in front of Dante
            and saves his life while giving up her own. In his rage, Dante devil triggers, channeling Sparda's power
            through himself to gain his father's form and promptly defeats Mundus. <br>

            After returning from the battle to Trish's body, he leaves the pendants and the Sparda Sword with her. <br>

            Returning to the castle, an injured mutated Mundus confronts Dante again. In the midst of their battle,
            Trish returns and tells Dante to use her power, channeling her energy through him. Dante does so and seals
            Mundus again with a classic move from his younger days. After this, Trish and Dante escape the island on a
            plane as it collapses and become partners. <br>

              Dante is a freelance underground mercenary in modern America. 
              But his secret persona is even more extraordinary! He slays bloodthirsty devils from the depths of burning hell with his huge sword and dual-wielded handguns. 
              Even a devil may cry begging for Dante's mercy.

            Trish is a hauntingly beautiful woman who invites Dante to Mallet Island, gateway to the devil world. 
            She possesss supernatural powers and vast knowledge about devils. 
            It is said she knows Dante's secret history. 
            But what is her true identity and purpose?

              Since many of the greater devils appearing in literature were once greater angels, it is not surprising that this black knight is called Nelo Angelo, the "black angel".
              It is said that he fights his enemy fairly and squarely, a rarity in a warrior from hell.
               If he is truly a practitioner of honor, why does he follow the Dark Power?
